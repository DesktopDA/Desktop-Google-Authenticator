## Improved and Enhanced Version

Once an account is successfully added, the system begins generating time-based one-time passwords (TOTPs). These codes are displayed in real-time and refresh periodically, providing the necessary authentication tokens for secure access to your Google accounts. This feature ensures that your accounts are protected with an additional layer of security, making it more difficult for unauthorized users to gain access. The continuous generation of these codes is a key aspect of the two-factor authentication process, enhancing both security and convenience.
